      <h2>Project Experimence</h2>
      <li>2019-2020  WeChat applet development project for campus market trading.</li>
      <p>As the team leader, he is mainly responsible for the front-end development and interface building of the WeChat applet.</p>
      <li>2021.12-2022.8  The federated learning project cooperated by ICES Lab and China Unicom Payment Corporation.</li> 
      <p>In the early stage, he was responsible for the research and learning of homomorphic encryption algorithms and the research of federated learning algorithms such as logical regression under semi-homomorphic encryption. In the middle stage, he is responsible for the deployment of the stand-alone FATE framework and the operation and implementation of the FATE federated learning algorithm. In the later stage, he is responsible for the cross-version transplant of  vertical federated model merge, and writing the report for final check. He has done experiments and written technical documents many times, which have been highly praised by teachers.</p>
      <li>2022.3-2022.7   Internship in the ITML lab of Tsinghua University. </li>
      <p>He mainly studies federated/distributed gradient compression algorithms and gradient-based leakage attacks. During this period, he assists his fellow to finish an article and contribute it to INFOCOM.</p>
